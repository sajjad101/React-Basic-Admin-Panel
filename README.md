# Admin Panel Starter

Welcome to the **React Basic Admin Panel** project! This is a basic admin panel built using **React.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**. The goal of this project is to create a flexible and easy-to-use admin panel framework that can be extended and customized for various use cases.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early and improve the development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive and modern designs quickly.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation and routing within the app.
